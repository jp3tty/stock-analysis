# Green Stock Analysis
Performing analysis on a group of stocks with VBA.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create an efficient, user-friendly Excel interface for performing stock analysis. To manage this task, a VBA subroutine was employed that reports a given stocks performace (Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return Percentage) over the course of a year. As an input, the subroutine prompts the user to pick the year they wish to analyze. The data is then processed and the desired information is output to its own Excel worksheet for the user to view.

# Analysis and Challenges

The subroutine provides an array of tickers (stock symbols) as reference and generate a report the Total. from a dataset by comparing tickeoff of an array of ticker symbols to compare their volume, starting price and ending price. In addition to this performace analysis, the subroutine also reported the results and provided the user a means to initiate the analysis through the use of buttons and an input box.
