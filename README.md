# Stock analysis for Steve's parents (Module-2-Challenge)
Performing analysis on a set of stocks with VBA.

## Purpose

Our friend Steve wants to help his parents with their stock selection. He asked if we could help  The goal of this project is advise a client and potential theatrical director, Louise, for the best time of year to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund her upcoming play, Fever. This exercise was an introduction to the Excel's ability to use Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Conditional Fomatting, and a number of other functions to perform statistical analysis and generate graphical representations of data.

# Analysis and Challenges

Analysis for this project began by getting to know the dataset provided for Kickstarter campaigns launched from 2009 to 2017. Our client would like to answer two questions:

1. Is there an optimal time of year to start a theatrical Kickstarter campaigns?
2. How do the funding goals for a play effect the success of the Kickstarter campaign?

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data provided contains the information we need but not in the format to easily create graphical representations for quick reference. To answer both questions, I began by the years into a "Years" column on the worksheet by extracting it from the "Date Created Conversion" column in the orignal data. Using the years I could create a Pivot table to see theater campaign outcomes based on their launch date that is capable of filtering per year and parent category. Successful, canceled, and failed Theater outcomes were plotted in a Pivot chart to communicate with the client
